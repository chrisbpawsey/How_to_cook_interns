\subsubsection{Hybrid Examples}

The OpenMP/MPI source codes used for Zythos were \emph{hybrid\_hello.f90} and \emph{hello\_hybrid.c} which were exactly the same as Zeus. These codes 
were compiled with all the compilers available on Zythos and before compiling it was made sure that the right module was loaded by using the same 
commands in the MPI examples of Zeus. Similarly, the compiler commands for Zythos with the hybrid jobs were exactly the same as the ones for the hybrid 
jobs of Zeus. The only difference between the OpenMP/MPI exaples of Zythos and Zeus was running the task on Zyhtos as srun was no longer used, but 
instead mpirun with omplace was implemented for these examples on Zythos. 

The characteristic approach to run hybrid jobs on Zythos is by running one MPI task for per 6-core NUMA region. This job script contains a request for 4
nodes and begins 4 MPI tasks by using mpirun that is combined with omplace to place threads.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize]
#SBATCH --partition=zythos
#SBATCH --account=pawsey0001
#SBATCH --ntasks=4
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=6
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

To run the codes on Zythos, the number of OpenMP threads were given and passed the message through the mpirun as:

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize]
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=6
mpirun -np 4 omplace -nt $OMP_NUM_THREADS ./$EXECUTABLE
					 >> ${OUTPUT}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

These commands remain the same for all the SLURM scripts with different compilers for the hybrid jobs on Zythos.

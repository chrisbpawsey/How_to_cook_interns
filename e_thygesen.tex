\section{Panna cotta}

\section{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
        \item 500ml thickened cream
        \item 150ml whole milk
        \item 180g caster sugar
	\item 1 vanilla pod
	\item 3 leaves gold leaf gelatine
	\item Berries, to serve
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Place the cream, milk, sugar, and scraped vanilla beans and pod in a large pan. Stir over a low-medium heat and slowly bring to the boil. When the mixture just reaches the boil, remove from the heat immediately.
\item Meanwhile, place the gelatin leaves in a shallow dish, and then cover in cold water to soften for 5 minutes. Remove the gelatin from the water and squeeze out any excess water. Whisk the gelatin into to the cream mixture until dissolved.
\item Allow the mixture to cool slightly and then strain through a sieve into a jug. Pour into 6x120ml capacity pudding moulds, and then transfer into the refrigerator for 5 hours or until set. The panna cottas should still have a slight wobble to them once set.
\item Remove the panna cottas from the fridge and run a sharp knife around the edge of the moulds. Dip the moulds briefly into hot water and then use your fingers to gently loosen the panna cottas away from the edges. Turn upside down to release the panna cottas from the moulds.
\item Serve the panna cottas immediately with berries. 
\end{enumerate}

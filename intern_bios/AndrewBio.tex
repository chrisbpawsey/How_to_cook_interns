My name is Andrew Sorbello, and I am a penultimate chemical engineering student at Curtin 
University. The project I have been awarded (Project 6) at Pawsey Supercomputing pertains 
to the ionisation of organic acids at the air water interface, supervised by Dr. Chi Phan of 
Curtin. My tasks are orientated around the determination of radial distributions and 
diffusion coefficients of decanoic and stearic carboxylic acids within the bulk solution and 
surface layer via molecular dynamics simulations. In this instance, hydrophilic head and 
hydrophobic tail groups dictate the interfacial behaviour in the protonated state, and are 
poorly understood. As such, this field requires further investigation with the application of 
various thermodynamic models to gain insight into these equilibrium mechanisms.

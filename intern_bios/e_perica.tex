\section{My Biography}
Elizabeth Perica's biography for the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre Summer internship.
\subsection{About me!}
My name is Elizabeth Perica and I will be completing my final year of Medical Imaging Science at 
Curtin University in 2017. The project I will be working on for my internship is titled 
“Patient-specific 3D printing for pre-surgical planning in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.” 
I am excited by the possibilities of 3D printing in the medical field, especially its role in 
enhancing clinical practice and its utilization of medical images in realistic physical model 
generation. Patient-specific 3D models are extremely valuable tools within the clinical setting, 
especially in the planning of unique treatment strategies and education. I believe that this 
internship will allow me to advance my knowledge and experience gained at university, by granting 
me the opportunity to learn about the application of the latest scientific computational 
technologies in the field of medical imaging.

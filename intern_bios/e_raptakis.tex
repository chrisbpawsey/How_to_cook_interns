\section{My Biography}
Hi there! My name is Emmanouil Raptakis and I am a Bachelor of Science student at UWA majoring in Physics and Mathematics and Statistics, having just finished my second year. 

\section{About Me}
At UWA I am also involved in the Spintronics and Magnetisation Dynamics Group, currently as an experimentalist researching methods of magnetic nanoparticle detection from the perspective of ferromagnetic resonance in magnonic crystals. My project is a collaboration between ICRAR and the Pawsey Centre (supervised by Professor Andreas Wicenec and Dr Chen Wu) aimed at investigating the role and influence of digital noise and inaccuracies in the representation of real numbers in the current standard in scientific computing (the IEEE 754 floating point representation) such as the contradictory statement $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$ not holding in general. From the strong foundations laid out in John Gustafson's book ``The End of Error: Unum Computing'' I intend to find various Astrophyisical cases where the IEEE format gives wildly incorrrect results and implement Gustfson's alternative number format (the UNUM) to attempt to resolve the issue. This project is exciting and of importance since it will allow for the potential resolution of these ``digital'' errors in scientific computing and a decrease in power consumption in computing.

\section{About me (and the project)}
My name is Erica Thygesen, and I’ve just finished my Bachelor of Science with first 
major in Physics and second major in Music. The main goal of my project is to identify 
nuclear supermassive black holes in three nearby dwarf galaxies corresponding to about the 
size of the Large Magellanic Cloud or smaller. The reason that dwarf galaxies in particular 
are being used for this study is that they are comparable to early universe galaxies, which 
allows us to put empirical constraints on early black hole growth. I will be analysing X-ray 
observations of the three dwarf galaxies using data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Satellite, and 
from this determining if these galaxies contain nuclear supermassive black holes or off 
nuclear X-ray binaries. If time permits, I will incorporate radio data from the Very Large 
Array and optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope to analyse the multiwavelength 
properties of the observed sources, with the aim to characterise the nature of X-ray 
populations in dwarf galaxies. As this is my first research project I am excited to gain 
experience in this area - and of course I hope to find some black holes!

Ian Gao biography for the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre Summer internship
\subsection{about me!}
Hello! My name is Ian, I am doing electrical and electronics engineering alongside with computer science at UWA. 
For this internship I will be working under Professor Nimal Subasinghe and Dr Andrew Squelch for the Quantification of mineral distribution in ore particles from XrayCT scan images project. 
This project aims to develop a workflow that can quantify the mineral distributions in ore particles with a 3D approach utilising software AVIZO.
This internship would a great opportunity for me to apply my skills in real life application and develop my ability to transfer academic knowledge into  actual meaningful product. I am really looking forwards to the challenges this project will present and the knowledges I would gain during the process.

Ivan Lau biography for the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre Summer Internship

\subsection{About Me}
I am a third year Medical Imaging student from Curtin University and just about to enter my exciting final year next year.
In this internship, I will be working closely with Professor Zhonghua Sun and Dr. Andrew Squelch on the project with title "Patient-Specific 3D Printed Models of Congenital Heart Diseases".
The aim is about determining the clinical value of realistic 3D printed heart models in helping physicians to understand patient-specific cardiovascular pathology and thus improving the presurgical planning in congenital heart diseases. 
I am hoping to gain experience and develop skills in planning and conducting scientific and academic research, and more importantly, I am excited to see how the programming skills and supercomputers can help me to conduct a much better and faster research.

\subsection{about me!}
Hi, my name is Josh and I will be going into my final year of Chemical Engineering in 2017. I will be doing a project on carbon capture and storage, titled "Wettability studies and molecular dynamics simulation of CO2 and formation water on calcite surfaces." Carbon capture and storage looks at pumping CO2 back into extracted underground petroleum reservoirs to reduce man-made CO2 emissions. I will be working with Professor Stefan Iglauer and his PhD student, Kofi Ofori based in Tech Park just around the corner. I will be using a molecular dynamics simulator called LAMMPS which has a 1800 page manual :') Through this internship, I hope to apply my programming skills to contribute in sustainable engineering research. I like cookies and cream ice cream and supreme pizza #basic

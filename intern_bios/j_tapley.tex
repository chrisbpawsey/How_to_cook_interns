\section{My Biography}
Jonathan Tapley for the pawsey summer internship
\subsection{About meh!}
Hey guys, my name is Jonathan Tapley I’m completing my Bachelor of Science (honours) currently  in my third year majoring in physics at UWA. I taken advantage of UWA’s “broad” undegraduate degree structure having completed units in computer science, psychology, pharmacology and physiology along side my physics major.

The project I have been assigned is with Prof. Dmitry Fursa at Curtin University in the field of atomic collision theorey. Specifically, I’ll be looking at electron excitation cross sections of the h2 molecule using the Convergent Closed Coupling method they developed. That is, the probability of different atomic transition occuring in vibrationally and excited states of h2 upon collision with an electron at a range of incident energies. I believe the relevance lies in constructing the next generation of nuclear fusion reactors – as this models proccesses that will occur during nuclear fusion.

Hopefully, I will develop not only supercomputing skill through use of magnus, but also improve and reinforce current computational skills; ideally being able to pipline data creation/aquisition proccessing and analysis in shell scripts. Furthermore, developing research skills (both independent and collabrative) and gaining a research mentor. Lastly, I am planning on a honours year in 2017, so could potentially extend the project into my honours.

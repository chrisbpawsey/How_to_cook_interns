\subsection{about me!}
I am a student at UWA, and have just finished my honours year.  In my undergraduate degree I studied mechanical engineering and physics, and completed my honours in physics, with coursework in geophysics and computational physics, and a project in experimental physics, using a result from laser spectroscopy to aid the cooling of an atom cloud, to help improve a (atomic) optical lattice clock which is being built at UWA.  My Pawsey project is supervised by Professor Wang, and involves using machine learning to improve the implementation of quantum computing algorithms.  In the immediate future I plan to complete a Masters of Professional Engineering, to then work as an engineer.  In my spare time I enjoy hiking, mountaineering (when I can) and kayaking.

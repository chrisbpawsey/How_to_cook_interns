\section{My Biography}
Liam Scarlett biography for the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre Summer internship
\subsection{About me}
I have recently completed my undergraduate physics degree at Curtin University. 
During the Pawsey internship I will continuing work on a computational physics project 
with Prof. Dmitry Fursa at Curtin. We have been calculating kinetic energy release
cross sections for electron scattering on H$_2^+$, and we now plan to parallelise the FORTRAN
code, and explore correction to the theory to improve the agreement of our results with
experiment. I hope to develop skills in parallel programming
and learn more about how the supercomputing systems work.

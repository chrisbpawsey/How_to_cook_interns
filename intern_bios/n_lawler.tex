\subsection{About me}
I am a second year Bachelor of Philosophy (Honours) student from UWA, majoring in Physics and Engineering.
I am working with Professor Kenji Bekki from ICRAR to explore galaxy transformation from early- to late-types. This involves the investigatation of which physical conditions of `E-Spâ€™ merging result in the formation of a new disk galaxy. The simulated distributions and kinematics of gas and stars will be compared with corresponding observations of disk galaxies.

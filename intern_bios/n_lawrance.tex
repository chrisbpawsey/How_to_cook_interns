\section{Nicholas Lawrance}

Nicholas studied a Bachelor of Philosophy with a double major in mathematics and computer science at UWA and completed his honours year in applied maths with a topic in network science looking at the Perth water network. For his Pawsey project he will be parallelising existing network analysis algorithms to allow larger networks to be studied. He will then use these algorithms to characterise large networks that would otherwise have been infeasible. This project is partially motivated by his honours project where he encountered significant computational boundaries due to the network's size, it contained 240,000 nodes and 267,000 links. Now that he has completed his degree, Nicholas plans to work in data analysis making use of his maths and computing skills.

Ozlem Erkilic's Biography for Pawsey Supercomputing Centre

/subsection{!about Ozlem }
I am Ozlem Erkilic. I study Physics and Electronic and Communication
Engineering at Curtin University. I just finished the third year of my degree
and still have 2 more years to graduate. The reason I choice this degree is
that it combines the practical side of engineering with the critical thinking
of Physics and hence, this degree is very versatile.
I don't currently have an internship with Pawsey Supercomputing Centre. However,
I attended Pawsey training week in which I have learnt various tools that can
contribute to my Physics and Engineering Research Projects.

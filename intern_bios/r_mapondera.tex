Ranganai Mapondera

 I am Ranganai Mapondera. I am a last year student currently studying Chemical Engineering at Curtin University.I am currently an intern at Pawsey Supercomputing Centre. 
My internship project works towards Reducing Barriers to Entry on Shared HPC Resources. The getexample command was developed to provide customized examples specifically designed to work “out of the box” on the institution’s High Performace
Computing (HPC) resources in an effort to reduce barriers to entry for users for one Advanced Computing system.To my understanding, we have to use the gitexample command with different commands to check and reduce the barriers from entering the resources of the HPC for the users.

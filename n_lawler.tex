\section{Instructions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Heat oven to 425ÂºF. Prepare Double-Crust Pastry.

\item Roll other round of pastry. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 3-inch strip of aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning.
